# CMS_database

## Description
This application was created so internet retail companies can utilize a MySQL database and keep an up-to-date record of certain categories, products, and tags related to the sale, and inventory of their e-commerce business. This application uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The use of an ORM (object-relational-mapping) dependency (Sequelize) rather than strictly using MySQL query's helps make this particular projects code more readable and reusable, and helps further the organization of project code through destructuring of larger files into more manageable pieces. This can also help isolate bugs, keeps the code DRY, and makes code more maintainable for future development.

This project is just the beginning of a complex back end application and can be interacted with through the use of tools such as Insomnia.

## Technology 
This application is powered by Node.js (v16.19.1), Express.js (v14.17.1), JavaScript, MySQL, and Sequelize (ORM). It utilizes the node package manager (npm) dependencies sequelize (v5.22.5), mysql2 (v2.3.3), express (v4.17.1), dotenv (v8.6.0), and nodemon (v2.0.3).
